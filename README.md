# Automation Framework with Python and Pytest

This project is a demonstration of a robust test automation framework using Python and Pytest.
I chose academybugs.com as an example of how the framework can be used. Academybugs.com (part of uTest's academy)
is a web app with hidden bugs, where beginner testers can practice their bug hunting skills.
Tests included in this framework cover all 25 bugs, each in a separate test.


## Features

- **Pytest Framework:** Utilizing the powerful Pytest framework for efficient and scalable test automation.
- **Page Object Model (POM):** Organizing the codebase with the Page Object Model design pattern for maintainability and readability.
- **Modular Structure:** Dividing the project into manageable modules for ease of maintenance and scalability.
- **WebDriver:** Integration with Selenium WebDriver for cross-browser testing and interaction with web elements.
- **Configuration Management:** Centralized configuration management for handling test data and environment configurations.
- **Logging and Reporting:** Incorporating logging for detailed test execution information and HTML reports for clear result visualization.

## Prerequisites

Before running the tests, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7+
